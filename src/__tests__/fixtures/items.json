As a result it is ok to acknowledge any alert and contact Membership AIM during normal hours if the problem cannot be resolved by following the guide below.<br/><br/>Access uses tungsten in a multi-master configuration to replicate user decisions, where they've been granted access to view an article or not, to all hosts in the cluster. Access currently has 6 hosts in the UK and US, listed in the hardware section above, that each have a tungsten service name (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot). When a service, e.g Alpha, is deemed as being in an OFFLINE state the node corresponding to the service will fail to replicate data to the other service nodes. <br/><br/>Logs: /opt/continuent/tungsten/tungsten-replicator/log/trepsvc.log<br/><br/>Where a tungsten service is reported as being in an offline or error state you can attempt to bring the service back online by running either <i>trepctl -service &lt;service_name&gt; online </i>or by performing a <i>service treplicator restart. </i>check the logs to see if any errors are being reported.<i> </i>If this hasn't brought the service back up this will need to be reported to Membership AIM.<br/><br/><b>Setting the site free<br/></b><br/>information <a href='https://sites.google.com/a/ft.com/technology/systems/membership/identity-and-access-management/02-sub-systems/access/engineering/02-wiki/setting-the-site-free'>here</a>.<br/><br/>\r\n</td></tr>\r\n</table>",
